# SQLDefentPro

## Introduction
SQLDefentPro is a project created by CY83R-3X71NC710N to detect and prevent SQL injection attacks by checking for suspicious string formatting and content in database queries. It is written in the Python programming language and uses NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to generate data visualizations of the suspicious queries and protection state of the system. This is a prototype and will likely need to be updated to run on the reader's own machine, with URLs and possible keys needing to be updated as well. This is a work in progress and as of now it should be built off and extended to become more powerful.

## What is SQLDefentPro?
SQLDefentPro is an algorithm created to detect and prevent SQL injection attacks. It is written in the Python programming language and uses NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to generate data visualizations of the suspicious queries and protection state of the system. It is designed to be used by corporations and individuals to help protect their databases from malicious attacks.

## Goals
- Create an algorithm to detect and prevent SQL injection attacks
- Generate data visualizations of suspicious queries and protection state of the system
- Create a prototype version of the algorithm that can be used by corporations and individuals
- Update the prototype to run on the reader's machine
- Extend the prototype to become more powerful
- Create an open source alternative to any closed-source APIs

## Roadmap
- Create the algorithm
- Generate data visualizations
- Create a prototype version
- Update the prototype
- Extend the prototype
- Create an open source alternative

## What makes SQLDefentPro Unique?
SQLDefentPro is unique because it is designed to detect and prevent SQL injection attacks by checking for suspicious string formatting and content in database queries. It also uses NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to generate data visualizations of the suspicious queries and protection state of the system. Additionally, it is designed to be used by corporations and individuals to help protect their databases from malicious attacks.
